Data Set Information:

Ref[1] presents 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity signals 
captured at 50 Hz rate by Samsung Galaxy S II smarphones worn by 30 human subjects 
while performing 6 different activities. In Ref[1], processed data consists of 561
features in addition to the subject and activity IDs.  This source data has been
randomly partitioned into 7352 training entries and 2497 test entries.

The source data has been processed according to instructions in Ref [2].  The train-
ing and test data sets are merged, with the subject and activity IDs as well as 
feature names added.  79 features corresponding to the mean and standard deviation 
(with feature names containing substring "mean()" or "std()") of each measured quantity
are retained.  Then these measurements are averaged over each subject/activity combination.
   
Attribute Information

Each record in the dataset (neatdata.txt) contains:
* Subject ID [1-30]
* Activity ID [1-6]
* Averaged value of 79 features over each unique subject/activity combination
