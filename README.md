# getdata033-proj
Course project for getdata-033

The R code assumes the source data has been unzipped into subdirectory 
"getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset" under the working directory.
Extensive comments have been added to the script file.

According to the discussion forum threads, there is ambiguity about 
whether *meanFreq()* should be included in step 2.  I have not included 
them hence there are 79 feature columns.

In neatdata.txt, angle brackets have been added to each feature column 
name to denote the fact they are averaged values.
